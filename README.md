FlashCard

This is the project for the final assessment project for React Native Udacity Course.





# To launch the app:


* cd FlashCard
* npm install or yarn install
* yarn start

Then click i to open the IOS emulator



# Infos about the application
I tested the app in the IOS emulator. On my Genymotion(Android) emulator the Cards are not flipping, and therefore its not possible to work on Android. It seems there is a bug in the library react-native-flip-card. On the IOS emulator everything works as expected.



#ToDo's
Following things I want to make,
* Create a new QuizCard Component, that works also for Android
* Improving the layout
